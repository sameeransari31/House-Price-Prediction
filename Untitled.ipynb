    "**Business Problem: House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As a real estate company, we often face challenges in accurately pricing houses. Prices depend on several factors like location, size, number of rooms, and other amenities, but manually predicting the right price can be time-consuming and subjective. We want to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on these key features. By doing so, we hope to offer more competitive and accurate pricing, helping both sellers and buyers make better, data-driven decisions in the real estate market."
